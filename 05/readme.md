I have done part 5 before the lab is setted up on Friday. Thus, I have pictures and videos of traces on a physical oscilloscope. 

A video recording is also included in the demo with explanation of the setup.

Since my team collaborate on this project, I will also include the team repo for further reference. My team is collaborating using the same repo: https://github.com/YuchenWang0303/Lab2b_part5-Yuchen-Wang-Worked-with-Katrina-Ji
